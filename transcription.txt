Community Update December 2019 posted on December 27, 2019 by Frederick Fondt hi everyone, welcome to a new community update. Yeah, we know we have not been updating you very regularly lately, but this does not mean we have not been working hard on free sound as has been the case for the last year. We have not been very much concentrated on working on either under the hood improvements or research type of issues which do not have a clearly visible output in the freesound website yet. But we are indeed working on great things which will definitely end up in the platform. Here is a summary of our current main working threads, bug fixes, general maintenance and software updates this is a big one as we are about to carry out necessary software updates for Nerds Python Django updates which affect all of our code base and are therefore quite time consuming. Boop. New features. We are working on new features mostly related to the search page. However, all these new features require a lot of previous research work. Don't forget we're a research institution, so that's what we do best. And again, features need their time to become a reality. The new search features we're working on will allow to cluster search results as well as adding new filtering options. New front end yes, we have not abandoned this one. It is going very slowly, much more than we thought, but it will eventually become a reality and it is indeed in our roadmap. Oh, and by the way, weve just published a tech oriented post about freesound in the Creative Commons Open source blog. You might want to check that out. And thats it for the short update. Thanks for reading and stay tuned for the updates in the coming year. Big happy new year to everyone.
